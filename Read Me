This Project is created by Aniruddh Tiwari (aniruddhtiwari83@gmail.com).

Scope: Project intends to to estimate pose using AI and converting it into inputs for gaming control to give more immersive experience to the user.

Current State: 4 poses are captures - jump and land with legs spread, tilt left wth left arm stretched on left side, tilt right wth rigth arm stretched on right side,and duck.
These poses are mapped with up, left, right and down arrows of the keyboard and can be used to control any software (intended for games).

Currently, attached video shows the author playing Temple Run from a random website on google. Another version of prject code is created to play car racing category games.

Future State: 
1) Work on known issues of ducking.
2) Work on increasing estimation speed to help play games on projectors.
3) Enhance to gain mouse control to expand game categories to boxing, penalty shoot out, golfing etc. 
4) Enhance pose estimation capabilities for capturing speed of action. This will be integrated and tied to video playing speed giving user an immersive experience of 
   running on tracks around the world or cycling on different track or boating on different water conditions. Can be linked to VR for 3-d experience.
